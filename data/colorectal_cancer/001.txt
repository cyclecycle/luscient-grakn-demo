B. fragilis toxin (BFT) does not exhibit cell lytic activity, but rather promotes cell proliferation. BFT increases barrier permeability with active secretion of chloride ions, actions known to promote diarrhea as well as colon inflammation and carcinogenesis. BFT induces the antiapoptotic protein cIAP2 and the polyamine catalyst spermine oxidase (SMO), which triggers ROS production, DNA damage, and cell proliferation. BFT also induces rapid DNA damage in colon epithelial cells in vivo, as detected by activation of H2A histone family, member X (H2AX), an initiator of DNA repair.
