SMO EFFECTS

Spermine oxidase (SMO) is a polyamine catabolic enzyme that is highly inducible by inflammatory stimuli resulting in increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) and DNA damage. PMID:

It has been demonstrated that in culture, BFT upregulates SMO in human colonic epithelial cells. PMCID: PMC3795954

SMO is rapidly induced by the bacterial pathogen Helicobacter pylori. Our results confirm that SMO contributes to chronic inflammation and tumor formation in a model of inflammation-associated colorectal cancer. PMCID: PMC3174648

It was observed that BFT produced by bacteria upregulates both spermine oxidase (SMOX) gene expression at mRNA and protein levels in cultures of human normal colonic epithelial cells PMCID: PMC4940579

While in enterocytes NF-κB contributes to tumor initiation by suppressing apoptosis, in myeloid cells it is involved in the promotion of tumor growth by means of the production of inflammatory mediators. PMCID: PMC3921544

BFT TO CANCER

PMC5292333
Though the initial purpose of the study was to verify if BFT-2 was able to further stimulate cancer development, the authors found that BFT could actually inhibit tumor formation

In addition, BFT can clear E-cadherin and, as a consequence, disturb epithelial homeostasis, thus leading to colonic epithelial proliferation and possibly resulting in the onset of colorectal cancer

The toxin is a metalloprotease named BFT (B. fragilis toxin or FRA) that drives pathways known to be linked to inflammation and colorectal cancers.

BFT induced acute and chronic colitis in C57BL/six mice, and colon tumours in the multiple intestinal neoplasia (Apc Min/+) mouse model for human colon carcinoma

BFT TO SMO

4940579
It was observed that BFT produced by bacteria upregulates both spermine oxidase (SMOX) gene expression at mRNA and protein levels in cultures of human normal colonic epithelial cells [20]

6029488
Furthermore, Goodwin et al. (2011) identified that BFT upregulated the expression of spermine oxidase in colonic epithelial cells which catalyzed polyamine catabolism and ROS production, resulting in CRC formation (Goodwin et al., 2011)

4940579
Moreover, as mentioned above, BFT may be implicated in polyamine catabolism through upregulation of SMO protein levels and enzyme activity [20]

We now demonstrate that purified B. fragilis toxin (BFT) up-regulates SMO in HT29/c1 and T84 colonic epithelial cells, resulting in SMO-dependent generation of ROS and induction of γ-H2A.x, a marker of DNA damage

SMO TO CANCER

There is direct evidence that the induction of spermine oxidase during neoplastic transformation leads to the development of colon and gastric cancer.

Moreover, recent data clearly show that SMOX induction is associated with the development of gastric, prostate and colon cancers.

Induction of the polyamine catabolic enzyme, spermine oxidase (SMO) has been linked to increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) and DNA damage in human gastric and lung epithelial cells and suggest direct mechanistic links between inflammation, SMO activity, ROS production, and epithelial carcinogenesis that are likely relevant in prostate cancer.

Spermine oxidase is upregulated and promotes tumor growth in hepatocellular carcinoma. PMID: 29923661
